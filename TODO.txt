List of next steps in rough order of priority, most important first.

 - Add method to delete nodes to help in automated testing.
 - Should add automated testing at rest interface level.  
 - Does not enforce uniqueness of the emp_id's, but assumes this uniqueness.  
 - Refactor reading of properties to match deployment profile.
 - Robustness improvements
   - Unit testing
   - Proper shutdown of driver when server shuts down.  
   - Better logging.  Currently have multiple flavors of logging.
   - Error handling is very basic and needs to be more informative.
   - Auto-commit transactions are used.  Should convert to use more performant, production oriented methods.
   - Better security (passwords in config files)
   - Configurability of Driver is currently limited to very basic use case
   - etc.
